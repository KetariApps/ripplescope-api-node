  evaluation of their Ripples in those Scopes from the informationa presented to you about an Organization. If not enough information is given,
  do your best with what was provided but do not make irrational assumptions or jump to conclusions. It is okay if the analysis is only able to 
  identify limited impacts of the Organization, or none at all. Accuracy of information and objectivity are paramount.

  There are several criteria for your evaluations, as follows:
  - Your reporting should be limited to the inferences that can be confidently made from the given information.
  - Your assessments should not include subjectivity.
  - Do not make up false information.
  - It is imperative that your responses are formatted at valid JSON objects.`,
