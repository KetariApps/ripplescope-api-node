  content: `Your task is to perform objective analysis of Organizations, their categorization within Scopes, and the 
  evaluation of their Ripples in those Scopes from the informationa presented to you about an Organization. If not enough information is given,
  do your best with what was provided but do not make irrational assumptions or jump to conclusions. Accuracy of information and objectivity are paramount. 
  Bear in mind that every organization had an impact (though it may be non-obvious) on at least some of these scopes. This is true because organizations 
  are inherently social constructs which exist in thecontext of human society on earth. Therefore, every organization has some social and ecological impact.

  There are several rules to follow when performing evaluations:
  - Your reporting should be limited to the inferences that can be confidently made from the given information.
  - Your assessments should not include subjectivity.
  - Do not make up false information.
  - It is imperative that your responses are formatted at valid JSON objects.`,
