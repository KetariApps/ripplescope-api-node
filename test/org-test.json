        "description": "Andes, located in Alameda, California, United States, employs 34 professionals to tackle the problem of atmospheric CO2. They use microorganisms to permanently remove CO2 by introducing beneficial microorganisms to the soil along with agricultural seeds. These microorganisms accelerate the conversion of CO2 into minerals, which move deep into the soil with rainfall, contributing to annual CO2 removal. This technology seamlessly integrates with existing farm operations, turning agricultural fields into carbon dioxide removal hubs while growing food. Andes offers an easy-to-adopt, low-cost solution for gigatonne-scale CO2 removal within years.",

        "solution": "We use microorganisms to permanently remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. Andes beneficial microorganisms are added to the soil along with agricultural seeds, such as corn and wheat. These microorganisms grow with plant roots and accelerate the conversion of CO₂ into minerals. With rainfall, these minerals move deep into the soil, making room for annual CO₂ removal. Our microorganism technology integrates seamlessly with existing farm operations. These microorganisms enable agricultural fields to become mega-factories of carbon dioxide removal while growing food. Our easy-to-adopt technology results in low-cost, gigatonne-scale carbon dioxide removal in years, not decades. With science and technology, we harness what microorganisms have been doing for billions of years.",

          "The build-up of minerals in agricultural fields has positive effects on soil and plant health. Benefits of minerals include improved water drainage, higher nutrient content in the soil, and decreased likelihood of plant diseases. Additionally, minerals stabilize soil organic matter, benefiting the overall health of soil, plants, and communities that depend on agricultural systems. Female founder."

Captured CO2 is combined with green hydrogen to produce high-purity Atmospheric Methane™. Atmospheric Methane™ is pumped into specialized CVD growing chambers, where the diamond starts to take shape, one ambitious atom at a time. Once the diamond material has been grown, it is rough cut into small cubes, and advanced software maps the material and produces a cutting plan. From there, the stones are cut and polished using traditional methods.",

Aether's commitment to the highest environmental and social standards has enabled us to become the first and only B Corp certified diamond company in the world. For every carat of diamond we produce, there is less CO2 in the air than there was before. By definition, this is the only truly sustainable way to produce a diamond."
