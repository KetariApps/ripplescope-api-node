        "solution": "SkyCool's vision is to improve the efficiency of all cooling systems by harnessing an untapped renewable resource: the sky. Our core innovation is a radiative cooling material that we've combined with a panel system to improve the efficiency of any vapor-compression based cooling system, saving our customers money and preventing the emissions of CO2 and other harmful greenhouse gases.",
        "team": "Skycool Systems has a dedicated team of 14 employees working towards a sustainable and energy-efficient future.",
        "geographic": "Skycool Systems operates in Mountain View, California, United States, and contributes to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions globally.",
        "misc": [
          "SkyCool Panels passively cool fluids in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Our panels are designed to connect into new and legacy cooling systems with minimal risk to the underlying system operation. Our panels achieve energy savings between 15% â€“ 40% as a function of the application and number of panels deployed."
