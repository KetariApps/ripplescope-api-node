          "Our Symbiotic™ Electrolyzers use process or waste heat across a wide temperature range—from 100 °C up to as hot as you can get it. By operating with steam, our electrolyzers tap into excess heat that is already available in industrial settings, lowering electricity use in tandem, usually below 35 kWh/kg, with 30 kWh/kg possible. And what's more, our technology uses abundant and widely available components to keep capital costs low – no expensive platinum-group metals, no iridium, no fluoropolymer membranes."
